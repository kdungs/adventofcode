# Advent of Code

Collections of my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
challenges over the years. For historic reasons, the solutions for each year
have a dedicated structure and might make use of several different programming
languages and technologies. Here's a short overview:

 - [2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019): _TBD_
 - [2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018): C++14 ([Bazel](https://bazel.io) build system)
 - [2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017): C++, Python, Haskell, Go, Java, Maths
 - [2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016): Haskell
 - [2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015): C++14 w/ range-v3 and Python
