# adventofcode2017
My solutions to the 2017 [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2017) puzzles.

After a quick poll on Twitter, I decided to go with a mix of languages for this year. Below you can find an overview of the laguages used each day. In some cases, I added keywords critical to the solution.

 * [Day 1](01/): C++ (`std::inner_product`)
 * [Day 2](02/): Python (`itertools.permutations`)
 * [Day 3](03/): Analytical solution and C++
 * [Day 4](04/): Haskell (`filter`)
 * [Day 5](05/): C++
 * [Day 6](06/): C++
 * [Day 8](08/): Go
 * [Day 9](09/): Java (_state machine_)
 * [Day 11](11/): Haskell (_cube coordinates_)
 * [Day 12](12/): Go (_BFS, UnionFind_)
