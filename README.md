# adventofcode
My solutions to the Advent of Code challenge. I use C++14 with the
[`range-v3`](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) library from Eric
Niebler. The idea is not to get the solutions out as quickly as possible but
rather take some pensive time in advent to play around with the library and get
used to it.

The input files are not provided in order to prevent clutter in the repository.
Also, as far as I understand, they are different for each participant.

## Compilation
Adjust the Makefile to contain the path to `range-v3` on your system. Then it's as easy as `make`. All binary files end up in a folder called `bin` and take a file name as input.
