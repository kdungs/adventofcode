Solving [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/) using
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

Neither do I attempt to solve the problems quickly enough to compete on the
leaderboard nor do I pride myself on writing extremely performant Haskell code.
This is merely an exercise in using Haskell for some "real world" applications.
Feel free to open issues whenever you see room for improvement but please
provide explanations. ☺
