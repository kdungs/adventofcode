# AoC 2021

Normally, I'd regard Advent of Code as an opportunity to practice good
engineering or learn a new language. Not this year, though. Because I have very
limited time, I just want to write the quickest, ugliest Python code that gets
the job done without spending too much time and / or thought on the exercises.
I didn't even bother to set up any tooling for the project.
