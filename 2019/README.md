# Advent of Code 2019

This year, AoC is a two-fold challenge:

 1. I am, once again, using it to get better at programming in Haskell.
 2. At Point 8, I started a challenge among my co-workers where the person (â‰ 
    me) with the highest score would get a prize at the end of December.
    Naturally, I want to lead by example so I have to stay ahead of the
    competition :P.

The combination of the two means that the code will usually be far from perfect
at the time it produces a working solution. How much time I will spend
refactoring it, will be decided on a day-to-day basis. ;)

In order to get better at writing Haskell, I started using `hfmt` and `hlint`
and will incorporate their suggestions diligently.

Since the "ship's computer" keeps coming up in multiple problems, I might
refactor it into a dedicated module at some point. For now I've just been
copying the code. Of course, that's not usually a nice pattern but at least it
yields self-contained solutions for each day...
