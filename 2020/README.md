# Advent of Code 2020

After last year's adventures in Haskell, this year it's back to the basics.
I'll do the whole thing in C++. That should be a nice opportunity to catch up
with what has happened to the language since C++14.

For a build system, I'll use [bazel](https://bazel.build/), because it's really
good.

For testing, I'll use [Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest).

Also, I might use [Abseil](https://abseil.io/) where it makes sense.
